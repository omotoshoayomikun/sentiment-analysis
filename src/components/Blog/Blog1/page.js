          Before you hit that “post” button, take a moment to consider who will
          be reading your message. Understanding your audience is crucial for
          crafting a sentiment that will connect with them. Ask yourself:

            <b>Who are they? </b>Are they friends, family, colleagues, or a

          <li>
            <b>What are their interests and values? </b>Tailor your message to
            align with what matters to them.
          </li>
          <li>
